# clima_flutter
I created a Weather App using Flutter that shows real-time weather details for different countries. The app uses the http package to fetch weather data from an API and the geolocator plugin to get the user's location.

Features:
Live Weather Data: Displays temperature, humidity, and more.
Search by Country: Look up weather in any country.
Challenges:
API Integration: Handling network requests and errors.
Geolocation: Managing location permissions and accuracy.
This project helped me practice working with APIs, geolocation, and building a clean UI in Flutter. Check out the code on GitHub!
